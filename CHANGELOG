# Change Log

## Unreleased
- Extracted AD5144 driver into a seperate library.
- Moved code into a single sketch.
- Renamed command `SET PE GAIN` to `SET GAIN`.
- Added command `SET OFFSET`.
- Removed command `SCAN THR`.
- Changed `SCAN THR` to scan both channels from 0 p.e. up to the highest possible threshold simultaneously.
- Changed threshold to wait for the end of the scan to print the measured data on the serial port.
- Added dynamic adjustment of integration time based on last frequency measurement.

## 0.6
- Changed event loop to use millis() instead of delay(). Commands are handled faster now.
- Added RTC support.
- Added LCD support (disabled).
- Added temperature measurement via BME280 (disabled).
- Added 40us delay after change of potentiometer value to wait for the switching noise to decay.
- Added command `GET TEMP`.

## 0.5
- Added commands `SET PE GAIN $CH, $VAL` and `SET PE THR $CH, $PETHR`.
- Use space as delimiter in the serial output.
- Added the current threshold setting in photoelectrons to the serial output.

## 0.4
- Use FreqCount instead of self-written function based on delay to measure the frequency.
  The frequency input is on pin 47 instead of pin 2 (Arduino MEGA) now, the interrupt handler
  captures rising edges on this pin.
- Print calculated frequency in Hertz independent of the configured integration time.

## 0.3
- Replaced command `SET $CH, $THR` by `SET THR $CH, $THR` and `SET WIDTH $CH, $THR`.
- Replaced command `SCAN $CH` by `SCAN THR` to scan both treshold channels simultaneously.
- Added trigger event sum to serial output.

## 0.2
Initial version.
