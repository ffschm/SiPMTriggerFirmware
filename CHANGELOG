# Change Log

## Unreleased

## 0.5
- Added commands `SET PE GAIN $CH, $VAL` and `SET PE THR $CH, $PETHR`.
- Use space as delimiter in the serial output.
- Added the current threshold setting in photoelectrons to the serial output.

## 0.4
- Use FreqCount instead of self-written function based on delay to measure the frequency.
  The frequency input is on pin 47 instead of pin 2 (Arduino MEGA) now, the interrupt handler
  captures rising edges on this pin.
- Print calculated frequency in Hertz independent of the configured integration time.

## 0.3
- Replaced command `SET $CH, $THR` by `SET THR $CH, $THR` and `SET WIDTH $CH, $THR`.
- Replaced command `SCAN $CH` by `SCAN THR` to scan both treshold channels simultaneously.
- Added trigger event sum to serial output.

## 0.2
Initial version.
